Description: We were asked to make a multiplication table generator
using javascript, HTML and css and Jquery. The user is asked to input 4 integers
(negative or positive). The program also accounts for invalid inputs

How to use it:
- Enter any 4 integers within -10 and 10
  - If it wrong it will tell you
  - If its out of range it will tell you
- Your table will first appear on the right hand side
- Click the multiplication button and it will appear in the tab section below the form

The tab section allows you to see your previous generated tables
It will also allow you to delete one by one with the x or multiple with the checkboxes
