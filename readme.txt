Description: The goal of this assignment was to redesign the first assignment.
I used a lot of what the professor has taught in class including h1, h2, p
div, img, links, scrolls, and alot of other things!

It passes both
o HTML5 Markup Validation Service: http://validator.w3.org or http://validator.nu
o W3C CSS Validation Service: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator
  This one has a few warnings but the professor said that was okay on Piazza
