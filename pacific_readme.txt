Description: The goal of this assignment is to style the pacific
html using only an external .css file. If you shrink the screen
size you will find that the html contents adjusts the same way
as the images in the HW3_zip/HW3_read. I first was doing a lot of
different css sizes depending on screen size but then I started
over and realized it could be a lot simpler. My most difficult part
was trying to change the michelle@bettencourt in the footer.
