/*
css code for the index of http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~mbettenc/pacific.html

The goal of this assignment is to style the pacific
html using only an external .css file. If you shrink the screen
size you will find that the html contents adjusts the same way
as the images in the HW3_zip/HW3_read.

I have included links to the helper cites I used.
I also used alot of w3 schools help throughout.

that it is only up until the text*/
