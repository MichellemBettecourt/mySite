ASSIGNMENT 1: Creating Your First Web Page
File: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~mbettenc/
Name: Michelle Bettencourt
E-mail: michelle_bettencourt@student.uml.edu
University affiliation: UMass Lowell student in GUI COMP.4610
Date: September 12, 2019
Description: This is first assignment of the course so it is pretty basic.
Since this is the index.html I plan on adding onto it later in the "table of
contents" part.

I used a lot of what the professor has taught in class including h1, h2, p
div, img and links!

It passes the test in 7b in the assignment details: https://validator.nu/
