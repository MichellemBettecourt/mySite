Description: We were asked to make a multiplication table generator
using javascript, HTML and css and Jquery. The user is asked to input 4 integers
(negative or positive). The program also accounts for invalid inputs

How to use it:
- Enter any 4 integers
  - If it wrong it will tell you
- Click the multiplication button and enjoy the table!
- If it is too large you may need to scroll

- Finally the clear, clears everything.

- I made it so that left column stays static that way you can
scroll horizontally but still see the y column
- To make up for the x inputs not being static, when you hover over a cell a
  small text will display a text a with an
__ x __ = __ explanation of the cell.

to see an example of an onhover in a big number

NEW JQUERY BENEFITS:
- If the user enters a letter, character or decimal the user will be told right
 away using a red error below and red border
- If the user tried to submit with wrong inputs OR no input an error message
will appear below using error text and red border
