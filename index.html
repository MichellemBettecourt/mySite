ASSIGNMENT 4: Styling Your First Web Page With CSS
File: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~mbettenc/
Name: Michelle Bettencourt
E-mail: michelle_bettencourt@student.uml.edu
University affiliation: UMass Lowell student in GUI COMP.4610
Date: October 06, 2019
Description: This is first assignment of the course so it is pretty basic.
Since this is the index.html I plan on adding onto it later in the "table of
contents" part.

I used a lot of what the professor has taught in class as well as my own
research and alot of trial and error.

It passes the test in: https://validator.nu/

              Since alot of the course work has multiple elements I decided
              include drop down menus for each assignment.
              Within the drop down is what ever is necessary for that assignment

              So when you hover over the text in droptown1 then the text in
              dropdown-content1 opens and so on and so forth

              If I choose to use javascript I would have been able to do This
              more efficiently
